    "Our visualization project aimed to explore migration patterns and trends to uncover the reality in Denmark. The chosen visualizations have proven to be effective in conveying the intended message and revealing insightful patterns in the data. However, to fully stimulate the viewer, the plots could have been more interactive showcasing each datapoint to be explored. We still find the level of complexity to be suitable for the story to be told and successfully enough to uncover the patterns and trends in the dataset. Even though, we have looked at the outside world to understand the overall trends in migration patterns, this could have further been explored to look for even more answers, which potentially could have uncovered additional insights. Furthermore, the findings of two datasets could lead to explore other datasets, explicitly looking at some of the most contributing countries' economic indicators to further understand the migration trends. \n",

    "Additionally, the visualization techniques effectively conveyed the story, but there may be opportunities to enhance the interactiveness and add more interactive elements to introduce even more playful features to the viewer. It could have been even more messaging or visual structuring tools to allow for more dynamically insights. This enables viewers to engage with the data more actively and customize their viewing experience according to their preferences. Furthermore, effectively guiding viewers through the narrative can ensure that key insights are communicated clearly. "
